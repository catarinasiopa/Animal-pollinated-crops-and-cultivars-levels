# Compilation lists - Animal pollinated crops and cultivars levels – a quantitative assessment of Pollinator Dependence values and evaluation of methodological approaches

Crop pollinator dependence (PD) values are key when assessing a pollinator’s contribution to agriculture, guiding management plans and policies for sustainable crop production. 
However, available global compilations of crops PD are outdated and neglect variability between related crops and accessions (variety/cultivar), as well as pollen limitation (PL), i.e. the production lost due to inadequate pollen receipt. 
Here, we obtained quantitative PD values for animal pollinated crops and their accessions, using data from available pollination experiments worldwide. 
We also tested pollination methodologies to assess their impact on PD values and to define suitable methodological guidelines for future pollination studies. 
We provide a list of continuous PD values for 141 crops, including 317 accessions and 37 crops not listed in previous assessments. 
We found that globally 74% of the animal pollinated crops are highly dependent on pollinators, and more than 40% of their production is associated with animal pollination. 
Pollen limitation was detected in 51% of the dataset entries, indicating that estimates calculated with open pollination studies underestimate crop pollinator dependence and, therefore, do not represent the true contribution of pollinators to food production.
Synthesis and applications:
The quantitative PD values provided here enable accurate quantifications of pollinator contribution to crop production, supporting pollinator-friendly practices in agroecosystems. 
These PD values are an invaluable baseline and a requirement for future accurate evaluations of the value of pollinators for food security. 
Furthermore, commonly applied methods for assessing PD values can lead to underestimations. 
Future crop pollination studies should perform complete pollination experiments to assess pollinator dependence levels that include pollen limitation, incorporating hand pollen supplementation, open pollination and pollinator exclusion treatments. 
Bigger scales, such as the whole plant or branch are preferable, and hand pollen supplementation should be applied to open flowers for the consideration of open pollination levels. 
Lastly, information regarding management practices and studied crop accessions should be accounted for, to an accurate assessment of the contribution of animal pollination to crop production.
